UVAFME (originally FAREAST; see [Yan & Shugart 2005](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3566334?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)) at the University of Virginia's Environmental Sciences Department in Hank Shugart's lab. It has since been used at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Northern Arizona University.

We are constantly updating and improving UVAFME's code. Please drop us a line if you are interested in contributing to UVAFME or if you have any questions about the model.
