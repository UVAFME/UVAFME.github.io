# Scale and Spatial Interaction

Currently, UVAFME sites do not interact with one another and thus may be run in parallel or in sequence. Within a site, several hundred (generally 200) independent plots about the area of influence of a dominant tree crown (e.g. 500 m<sup>2</sup>) are simulated that represent patches of a forested landscape. Forest "landscape" in this context is defined as a dynamic mosaic of forest gaps (i.e. patches/plots) (see [Shugart et al. 1985](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282756658_Modeling_Forest_Landscapes_and_the_Role_of_Disturbance_in_Ecosystems_and_Communities)). Within each patch, gap dynamics play out through the establishment of new trees following some major disturbance, growth and competition between trees to fill in the gap,  eventual dominance or co-dominance of a few trees, and death of such canopy dominants, which starts the cycle anew. Within UVAFME, the plots do not interact with one another, and thus represent independent replicates of potential forest dynamics occurring at a location with input environmental and climatological conditions. Due to the stochastic factors within UVAFME (i.e. disturbances, mortality, and regeneration), each plot will contain a forest patch undergoing some gap dynamics process, driven by both deterministic processes (e.g. tree growth response to external factors) and stochastic factors. A Monte Carlo-style average of such plots thus represents average, non-spatially explicit, per area *expected* forested conditions for the site location. This aggregation also produces emergent properties at the landscape scale (i.e. the average of several hundred gaps) such as forest succession, cyclical effects, and response to shifting climate and disturbance regimes.

Climate and daily weather conditions in UVAFME are the same across all plots within a site, thus each plot experiences the same temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and PET each simulation day. As of Version 3 of UVAFME, soil conditions within each plot are independent of one another, driven by the plot-wide factors such as climate and input/initial soil conditions, as well as plot-specific factors such as forest cover and disturbances. Additionally, within each plot individual trees are placed on a 30x30 grid, but only interact spatially with one another with respect to insect infestation. Each plot is assumed to be horizontally (but not vertically) homogenous with respect to canopy cover and leaf area, seed rain and seedling banks, as well as soil conditions.

# Climate

Climate in UVAFME is simulated through input distributions of monthly temperature (ÂºC), precipitation (cm), and cloud cover (tenths of sky covered). The average monthly minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation, and cloud cover, as well as standard deviations for these values (generally derived from at least 30 years of historical climate data) are used to create a range of possible values for a site in question. These monthly values are generated anew for each year of the simulation on each site and are equal across all plots within a site.

The monthly simulated weather data are used to generate daily values for each simulation year using a Gaussian approach for temperature and cloud cover. To generate daily precipitation values, the monthly precipitation is used to calculate the number of days it rains that month, and the amount of rainfall for each rain day. Monthly rain days are distributed randomly across the days in the month until all rain days have been filled.

## Climate Change
Climate change can be prescribed either linearly or via an input climate change file. Climate change, in the form of changing mean monthly temperatures and precipitation, is achieved by modifying the input values of average monthly minimum and maximum temperatures  and precipitation for a simulated site. Currently, all cloudiness variables and all monthly standard deviations do not change from the historical inputs during the climate change application.

## Altitudinal Change
Often it is beneficial to run the model at the same site latitude and longitude, but at different elevations (such as in studies in complex terrain for for testing applications). Both temperature and precipitation change as altitude/elevation changes. These changes can be generated in UVAFME using input values of the base site elevation, the new elevation (i.e. altitude), and temperature and precipitation lapse rates. As with climate change, these modifications are made to the initial input average minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation for a particular site.

## Solar Radiation
Daily and annual solar radiation is used to calculate potential evapotranspiration (PET) and permafrost dynamics (if present) within UVAFME. Previous versions of the model used top-of-atmosphere solar radiation to derive PET, however as of Version 3, surface solar radiation is used to account for the effects of slope, aspect, and cloud cover on solar radiation received at a surface.

## Potential Evapotranspiration
In previous versions of UVAFME, top-of-atmosphere radiation was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration (PET) using Hargreave's evaporation formula, however, studies have shown this equation to overestimate PET at high latitudes. In this version of the model, the formulation for PET was updated to use a modified Priestley-Taylor equation which uses surface solar radiation, allowing for the incorporation of topographic effects on PET.
